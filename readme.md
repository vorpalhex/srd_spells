Please use [5eTools](https://github.com/5etools-mirror-1/5etools-mirror-1.github.io/tree/master/data/spells) data instead.

This won't be getting additional updates as it's fairly behind already and much better versions of this exist now. The 5eTools version handles scaling, is much more complete, and has a better overall data structure.


# Spells from the SRD

This is a JSON formatted list of all the spells from the SRD, automatically pulled from @ephe's very nice [grimoire](https://github.com/jayrab/grimoire) with permission. This list has been both automatically and manually inspected, but is still likely to contain errors.

## General Format of a Spell

```javascript
{
  "name": "Acid Splash",
  "tags": [
    "sorcerer",
    "wizard",
    "cantrip"
  ],
  "type": "Conjuration cantrip",
  "ritual": false,
  "level": "cantrip",
  "school": "Conjuration",
  "casting_time": "1 action",
  "range": "60 feet",
  "components": {
    "verbal": true,
    "somatic": true,
    "material": false,
    "raw": "V, S"
  },
  "duration": "Instantaneous",
  "description": "You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.\n\nThis spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6)."
}
```

## Formatting notes

The description preserves whitespace in the form of linebreak characters (\n). If you want to display descriptions correctly in html, either wrap the description with `<pre>` tags or replace the \n's with `<br>`.
