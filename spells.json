As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.",

As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image o f a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.\n\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.",

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. If this Effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood Effect lasts.\n\nPart Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a Trench. The Trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The Trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. The water then slowly fills in the Trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over Obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely Directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain Conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect.\n\nWhirlpool: This Effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.",

If the Sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the Sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a Wall of Fire are suppressed within the Sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n* Spells: Any active spell or other magical Effect on a creature or an object in the Sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n* Magic Items: The Properties and powers of Magic Items are suppressed in the Sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's Properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the Sphere or wielded by an attacker in the Sphere. If a Magic Weapon or piece of magic Ammunition fully leaves the Sphere (For example, if you fire a Magic Arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\n* Magical Travel: Teleportation and Planar Travel fail to work in the Sphere, whether the Sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical Travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the Rope Trick Spells, temporarily closes while in the Sphere.\n* Creatures and Objects: A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the Sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the Sphere.\n* Dispel Magic: Spells and magical Effects such as Dispel Magic have no Effect on the Sphere.

If the cord is cut--something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does--your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.\n\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.

Light can pass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or Planar Travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken while the spell remains in Effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large, transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\n\nSlumber: The target falls asleep and can't be awoken.\nThe Special component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific herbs.\n\nEnding the Spell: During the casting of the spell, in any of its versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate as you choose, but the DM must agree that the condition is reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The Conditions can be based on a creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on observable Actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as level, class, or Hit Points.\n\nA _dispel magic_ spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.",

If you position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are wasted.\n\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.\n\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one layer at a time through all thew wall's layers. As it passes or reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be affected by that layer's properties as described below.\n\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed, it remains so for the Duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation destroys a prismatic wall, but an Antimagic Field has no Effect on it.\n\nRed: The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, nonmagical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\n\nOrange: The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place, magical Ranged Attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is destroyed by a Strong Wind.\n\nYellow: The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\n\nGreen: The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Passwall spell, or another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid surface, destroys this layer.\n\nBlue: The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\n\nIndigo: On a failed save, the creature is Restrained. It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the Petrified condition. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive, keep track of both until the creature collects three of a kind. While this layer is in place, Spells can't be cast through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a Daylight spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.\n\nViolet: On a failed save, the creature is Blinded. It must then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is transported to another plane of the DM's choosing and is no longer Blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

Worn equipment functions as normal. The DM determines whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect in that state.\n\nDuring this spell's Duration, you can use your action to assume a different form following the same restrictions and rules for the original form, with one exception - if your new form has more hit pints than your current one, your Hit Points remain at their current value.",

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\n\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\n\n* You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n* You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the _greater restoration_ spell.\n\n* You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\n\n* You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain attack.\n\n* You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accomodate the new result. For example, a _wish_ spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, you Strength drops to 3 if it isn't 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast _wish_ ever again if you suffer this stress.",

If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activate is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\n\nDeath: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.\n\nDiscord: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful Communication and has disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.\n\nFear: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While Frightened, the target drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each of its turns, if able.\n\nHopelessness: Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During this time, it can't Attack or target any creature with harmful Abilities, Spells, or other magical Effects.\n\nInsanity: Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane creature can't take Actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speaks only in gibberish. The DM controls its Movement, which is erratic.\n\nPain: Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and becomes Incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed save.\n\nSleep: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls Unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nStunning: Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes Stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.",

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.\n\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead view an illusion, or you were attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists.\n\nOn Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to go.\n\nOff Target: You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be travelled. For example, if you tried to Travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a Coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple Mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).",

For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell glyph*.\n\n* Explosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph.

In addition, at each intersection or branching Passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction from the one it chooses.\n\nDoors: All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if sealed by an Arcane Lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an Illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the Minor Illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.\n\nStairs: Webs fill all Stairs in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.\n\nOther Spell Effect: You can place your choice of one of the following magical Effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\n* Place *[dancing lights](../dancing-lights/ \"dancing lights (cantrip)\")* in four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.\n* Place *[magic mouth](../magic-mouth/ \"magic mouth (lvl 2)\")* in two locations.\n* Place *[stinking cloud](../stinking-cloud/ \"stinking cloud (lvl 3)\")* in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate; They return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.\n* Place a constant *[gust of wind](../gust-of-wind/ \"gust of wind (lvl 2)\")* in one corridor or room.\n* Place a *[suggestion](../suggestion/ \"suggestion (lvl 2)\")* in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area recieves the suggestion mentally.\n\nThe whole warded area radiates magic. A *[dispel magic](../dispel-magic/ \"dispel magic (lvl 3)\")* cast on a specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.\n\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year.",

For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge.

If you know a specific creature's name, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get a different creature anyway (DM's choice).\n\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to bargain for its services.\n\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you. As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000 gp per day. The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\n\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\n\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it, receiving a full share of experience points awarded.",
